# SQL Developer Internship â€“ Task 4  
**Topic:** Aggregate Functions & Grouping in SQL  

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
The goal of this task was to practice **aggregate functions** (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` to summarize and analyze tabular data.  
This task was completed using **MySQL** and the `LibraryDB` database.

---

**Tables Used:**
- `Categories` â€“ Stores book categories.
- `Authors` â€“ Stores author names.
- `Books` â€“ Stores book details.
- `Members` â€“ Stores member information.
- `Loans` â€“ Stores book loan transactions.

- ## ðŸ“Š Key Concepts Covered
1. **Aggregate Functions**
   - `SUM()` - Adds up numeric column values.
   - `COUNT()` - Counts rows or non-NULL column values.
   - `AVG()` - Calculates average values.

2. **GROUP BY**
   - Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns.
   - Can be used with multiple columns.

3. **HAVING**
   - Filters groups after aggregation.
   - Difference from `WHERE`: `WHERE` filters before aggregation, `HAVING` filters after aggregation.


## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **MySQL Workbench** â€“ To write and execute SQL queries.
  - **GitHub** â€“ For hosting and submitting the project files.
- **VS Code** â€“ For writing SQL scripts and managing files locally before uploading to GitHub.
